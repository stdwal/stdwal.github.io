We are never perfect as we born.

<!--more-->

We lost, we failed, we broken, we fell down.

But we hope, we recover, we rise, we march on.

We don't need to be great, don't need to shine like stars, and we can't always.

Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make who your are. It is the rest of your story, who you chose to be.

Everything we done defines us.
